# TensorFlow Federated Experimental

This directory contains experimental code that is being incubated and intended
to be surfaced through the `tff.experimental` namespace while we evolve the API
surface. Code quality, documentation, etc., are expected to be on par with the
rest of the codebase during the incubation process. Do not depend on this code
from other parts of TFF, as it can change at any time. All code included here
should retain private visibility while in the incubation stage (except for
what's necessary for inclusion in the `tff.experimental` API).
